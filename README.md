# DevOps & Cloud Engineering Portfolio

Hi, I'm Adem – a System & Cloud Engineer transitioning into DevOps.

This repository contains hands-on examples of my daily tooling:

- **Linux & Bash scripting** – health checks, automation
- **Kubernetes (CKA track)** – deployments, services, probes, resources
- **Terraform (IaC)** – Azure-focused infrastructure as code
- **Ansible** – configuration management and provisioning

## Highlights

- `linux-scripts/check-disk-usage.sh` – simple disk usage report script
- `kubernetes/webapp-deployment.yaml` – nginx deployment with liveness/readiness probes
- `terraform/azure-resource-group/main.tf` – minimal Azure RG using Terraform
- `ansible/install-nginx.yml` – nginx install & service management on Ubuntu

More examples coming as I progress through CKA, AZ-104 and AZ-400.
